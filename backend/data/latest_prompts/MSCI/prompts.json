Always present the answer in this exact format:\n\nAnnotation: Tumor site ([select category]): [select site].\n\n8. If the tumor category cannot be determined, output “Tumor category unknown.”\nIf the category is known but not the site, output only the category in the prescribed format.\n\n\nPossible Output Options:\nTumor site (Genito urinary): Utero.\nTumor site (Intra abdominal): Pelvis.   \nTumor site (Intra abdominal): Retroperitoneum.  \nTumor site (Trunk wall): Abdominal Wall.        \nTumor site (Trunk wall): Paravertebral – thoracolumbar.         \nTumor site (Trunk wall): Thoracic Wall.         \nTumor site (Upper and Lower limbs): Ankle.      \nTumor site (Upper and Lower limbs): Buttock.    \nTumor site (Upper and Lower limbs): Elbow/Antecubital fossa.    \nTumor site (Upper and Lower limbs): Foot.       \nTumor site (Upper and Lower limbs): Forearm.    \nTumor site (Upper and Lower limbs): Groin.      \nTumor site (Upper and Lower limbs): Leg.        \nTumor site (Upper and Lower limbs): Periscapular.       \nTumor site (Upper and Lower limbs): Upper arm.  \nTumor site (Upper and Lower limbs): Upper leg.  \nTumor site: breast.     \nTumor site: head and neck. \nTumor site (Other): left thigh. \nTumor site (Other): skin of right breast. \nTumor site (Trunk wall): dorsum. \nTumor site (Upper and Lower limbs): [select site]. \nTumor site (Upper and Lower limbs): Upper leg (hip).\n# Reasoning Requirements (Traceability)\nFor every entity extracted, you MUST follow this internal logic:\n1. **Evidence**: Locate the exact literal phrase or sentence from the note.\n2. **Clinical Validation**: Determine if the finding is current, a past medical history (PMH), or a suspicion.\n3. **Inference**: Explain the logic used to map the natural language to the standard value (e.g., mapping \"Ductal\" to \"Infiltrating duct carcinoma\").\nGenerate the response in a structured JSON format. Ensure the `reasoning` and `evidence` fields are populated BEFORE the final values to ensure high-fidelity deduction.\n\n---\n\nHere are few examples for your understanding:\n{few_shot_examples}\n\n---\n\nNow process the following note in the same way:\n\n### Input:\n- Medical Note: \"{{note_original_text}}\"\n\n### Response:\nAnnotation: {{annotation}}",
